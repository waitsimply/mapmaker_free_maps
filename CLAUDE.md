# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts free map images for teachers and journalists. All maps are created using [mapmaker.io](https://mapmaker.io).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to optimize for GitHub Pages hosting and SEO:

- `/maps/` - Directory containing map image files (PNG, SVG, etc.)
- `/thumbnails/` - Smaller preview versions of maps for faster loading
- `README.md` - Main documentation with attribution to mapmaker.io
- `index.html` - GitHub Pages landing page with gallery and search functionality
- `.github/` - GitHub-specific configuration and workflows

## SEO Considerations

When adding new content:

1. **Image filenames** should be descriptive and SEO-friendly (e.g., `world-political-map-2024.png` instead of `map1.png`)
2. **Alt text** must be comprehensive for accessibility and SEO
3. **README.md** should include keywords like "free maps", "educational maps", "teacher resources", "journalist maps"
4. **Metadata files** (if implemented) should include titles, descriptions, tags, and categories for each map
5. **sitemap.xml** should be maintained for search engine crawling

## Attribution

All documentation and pages must credit mapmaker.io as the map creation tool.
